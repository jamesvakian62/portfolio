        <div><p>            Next.JS Websites are my speciality and am skilled at developing, enhancing, integrating and supporting front end HTML-JSX, JSON, Responsive Website Design, and MongoDB Atlas websites. I use Next.JS with CSS, Bootstrap, W3CSS, and TailwindCSS resulting in displays for computers, tablets, and cellphone display equally. I also have React.JS experience for api and RESTful access database by MERN, MongoDB, Express.JS, React.JS, and Node.JS technologies. I develop and support an end to end software lifecycle across the entire software development of gathering, analysis, design, coding, testing, and deployment. Applications include eCommerce, personal, business, portfolios, informative, and accounting web databases. I am flexible and can move quickly from draft mockups into web languages. I have a real passion for the end-to-end solutions that drive the user experience and customer satisfaction from website database to mobile platform interactive display experience.</p>
