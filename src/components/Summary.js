          <b> React.JS / Next.JS Websites </b> are my specialty and am skilled
          at developing, enhancing, integrating and supporting front end
          HTML-JSX, JSON, Responsive Website Design, and MongoDB Atlas websites.
          I use Next.JS with CSS, Bootstrap, W3CSS, and TailwindCSS resulting in
          displays for computers, tablets, and cellphone display equally. I also
          have React.JS experience for api and RESTful access database by MERN,
          MongoDB, Express.JS, React.JS, and Node.JS technologies. I develop and
          support an end to end software lifecycle across the entire software
          development of gathering, analysis, design, coding, testing, and
          deployment. Applications include eCommerce, personal, business,
          portfolios, informative, and accounting web databases. I am flexible
          and can move quickly from draft mockups into web languages. I have a
          real passion for the end-to-end solutions that drive the user
          experience and customer satisfaction from website database to mobile
          platform interactive display experience.
